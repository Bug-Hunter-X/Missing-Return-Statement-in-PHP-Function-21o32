This repository demonstrates a common PHP bug: a missing return statement in a function. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.  The bug is that the `calculateSum` function, intended to calculate the sum of array elements, doesn't explicitly return the sum. This leads to an unexpected result. The solution adds the missing `return sum;` statement to fix the bug.
